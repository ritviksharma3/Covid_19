                            <strong> Hold the N95 mask in the palm of your hand. Check the mask to ensure it is in good condition. To apply it, point its nose up and let its elastics dangle towards the floor. Place the mask on your face, pull the bottom strap around your head, rest it below your ears. The top strap goes on the crown of your head. Remember, this order is important. Bottom strap always first. Mold the nose piece to fit your nose. Remember, comfort is important too. Less so, however.

Check for a good seal. Place hands in front of the mask and inhale quickly. Expect the mask to tighten around your face as you do. Place both hands completely around the mask. Exhale quickly. No air should leak through the mask’s edges. If air leaks around the nose, adjust the nosepiece. Around other edges? Adjust those straps.  Do you have a good seal? You should have a seal.
If you can’t quite get a seal, abandon this mask and try your luck with a different N95 make or model.
Don’t touch the mask itself. Remove the bottom strap first, followed by the top strap. Throw it in the trash.</strong>
